    "The security of models can be evaluated through the creation of *adversarial EXEmples*, carefully-manipulated Windows programs that evade detection of AI-based detectors.\n",
    "These can be formalized as a maximization problem as follows:\n",
    "$$ \\max_\\delta L(h(x;\\delta), y) $$\n",
    "where $\\delta$ is the manipulation to compute in order to maximize the classification error of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the worst-case scenario is posed by attackers with access to the target model. If this is also differentiable, they can compute *gradient-based*, since the gradient provides the best direction to follow to maximise the output of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by loading end-to-end models which can be attacked in this way, since they are differentiable and provide predictions without using any non-invertible feature extractor."
